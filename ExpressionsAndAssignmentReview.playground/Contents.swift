/* Overview
 
 Your assignment is to create your own programming problem using variables, operators, and assignment. Think about the Operators playground you completed. This assignment is like you are producing a page for that assignment. You will work on your playground page in a playground cloned from GitHub. It should include *at least* the following:
 
 - three arithmetic operators
 - one compound operator
 - three variables
 - one type conversion
 
 It's not very exciting to have a bunch of random numbers in code. When writing this problem you should be creating a story around it. This need not be tremendously complex, just a simple story that motivates the values being used and gives them a context.
 
 For example 40 / 5 isn't interesting, but writing a tree planting app that given a species of tree and how much space you have will estimate how many trees you can plant is moreso. (e.g., I have 40 sq ft and want to plant walnut trees. They need 5 sq ft of growing space around the trunk, how many can I fit?).
 
 You should write your story bits in comments (e.g., between /* and */, or lines starting with // ) around where the code should go.
